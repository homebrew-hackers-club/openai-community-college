# Chapter 3: Leveling Up Jarvis üöÄ

Welcome to the final chapter, future legend! Your Jarvis can already talk and hold conversations. Now it's time to transform him from a basic chatbot into a truly awesome AI companion with personality, special powers, and hacker-level features.

Time to become the Tony Stark of your friend group! üòà

## Give Jarvis a Personality (Sassy AI FTW) üòé

Let's start by giving Jarvis different personality modes. Create a new file called `advanced_jarvis.py`:

```python
import os
import pyttsx3
import random
from datetime import datetime
from openai import OpenAI
from dotenv import load_dotenv

# Load your secret credentials
load_dotenv()

# Initialize your AI connection
client = OpenAI(api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"))

# Initialize voice engine
voice_engine = pyttsx3.init()

class JarvisPersonality:
    """

        },
        "sassy": {
            "system_prompt": "You are Jarvis, but you're feeling sassy today. Be helpful but with playful sarcasm and wit. Don't be mean, just cheeky.",

## Practical Exercises: Become the Ultimate Legend üéØ

### Exercise 1: Add Your Own Commands
Create custom commands that are useful to you:

```python
elif command == "weather":
    return "I'd need a weather API to check that, but it's probably nice somewhere!"

elif command == "motivate":
    motivations = [
        "You're building amazing things! Keep going!",
        "Every expert was once a beginner. You're doing great!",
        "Your code is getting better every day!"
    ]
    return random.choice(motivations)
```

### Exercise 2: Create a Memory System
Add simple memory for Jarvis:

```python
class JarvisMemory:
    def __init__(self):
        self.user_name = None
        self.preferences = {}
    
    def remember_name(self, name):
        self.user_name = name
    
    def get_greeting(self):
        if self.user_name:
            return f"Hello {self.user_name}! How can I help you today?"
        return "Hello! What's your name so I can remember you?"
```

### Exercise 3: Add File Operations
Let Jarvis help with file management:

```python
elif command.startswith("create file "):
    filename = command.replace("create file ", "")
    try:
        with open(filename, 'w') as f:
            f.write("# Created by Jarvis\n")
        return f"File {filename} created successfully!"
    except:
        return "Sorry, I couldn't create that file."
```

## Sharing Your Creation üì§

### Create a Demo Script
Make a file called `jarvis_demo.py` that shows off your creation:

```python
from advanced_jarvis import *

def demo_mode():
    """Run a demo of Jarvis capabilities"""
    print("üé¨ JARVIS DEMO MODE")
    print("=" * 50)
    
    setup_voice()
    
    demo_commands = [
        "Hello Jarvis!",
        "Tell me a joke",
        "What's the time?",
        "personality sassy",
        "How are you feeling?",
        "status"
    ]
    
    for cmd in demo_commands:
        print(f"Demo: {cmd}")
        # Process the command
        input("Press Enter to continue...")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    demo_mode()
```

### Create Installation Instructions
Make a `README.md` file:

```markdown
