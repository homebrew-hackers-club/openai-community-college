# Basics of Prompt Engineering üéØ

## What is Prompt Engineering? ü§î

Prompt engineering is the art and science of crafting effective instructions for AI models to get the best possible results. Think of it as learning to speak AI's language fluently.

Just like how you'd give different instructions to a 5-year-old versus a college professor, you need to tailor your prompts based on what you want the AI to do.

**Bad prompt:** "Write something about dogs"
**Good prompt:** "Write a 200-word informative paragraph about Golden Retrievers, focusing on their temperament and why they make good family pets."

## Why Prompt Engineering Matters üî•

- **Better Results**: Get exactly what you need instead of generic responses
- **Save Time**: Reduce back-and-forth by getting it right the first time  
- **Save Money**: Fewer API calls = lower costs
- **Unlock AI Potential**: Access advanced capabilities you didn't know existed

## Core Principles of Great Prompts ‚ö°

### 1. Be Specific and Clear

**‚ùå Vague:**
```
Tell me about programming
```

**‚úÖ Specific:**
```
Explain the difference between Python and JavaScript for beginners, 
focusing on syntax differences and use cases. Provide a simple 
code example for each language.
```

### 2. Provide Context

**‚ùå No Context:**
```
Fix this code
```

**‚úÖ With Context:**
```
I'm building a React component for a todo app. This code should 
add a new todo item but it's not working. Here's the code:

[code here]

Please fix it and explain what was wrong.
```

### 3. Specify the Format You Want

**‚ùå No Format:**
```
List programming languages
```

**‚úÖ Formatted:**
```
Create a table with 5 popular programming languages, their primary 
use cases, and difficulty level (1-10). Format as markdown table.
```

### 4. Use Examples (Few-shot Prompting)

**‚ùå No Examples:**
```
Convert these product names to slug format
```

**‚úÖ With Examples:**
```
Convert these product names to URL-friendly slug format:

iPhone 13 Pro Max ‚Üí iphone-13-pro-max
MacBook Air M2 ‚Üí macbook-air-m2

Now convert these:
- Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra
- Google Pixel 7a
```

## Essential Prompt Techniques üõ†Ô∏è

### 1. Role-Based Prompting

Give the AI a specific role to play:

```
You are a senior software engineer reviewing code. Analyze this 
Python function for potential bugs, performance issues, and 
suggest improvements:

[code here]
```

**Other useful roles:**
- "You are a helpful teacher explaining to a 10-year-old..."
- "You are a technical writer creating documentation..."
- "You are an expert data scientist analyzing..."

### 2. Step-by-Step Instructions

Break complex tasks into clear steps:

```
Help me create a landing page for my app. Follow these steps:

1. First, ask me 3 questions about my app to understand it better
2. Based on my answers, suggest 5 compelling headline options
3. Create a basic HTML structure with header, hero section, features, and footer
4. Add CSS styling to make it look modern and professional

Start with step 1.
```

### 3. Chain of Thought Prompting

Ask the AI to think through problems step by step:

```
I have $1000 to invest. I'm 25 years old and want to invest for 
retirement. Walk me through your thinking process step by step 
to recommend an investment strategy. Consider my age, risk tolerance, 
and time horizon.
```

### 4. Constraint-Based Prompting

Set clear boundaries and limitations:

```
Write a blog post about AI in healthcare. Requirements:
- Exactly 500 words
- Include 3 specific examples
- Avoid technical jargon
- Write for hospital administrators
- Include a clear call-to-action at the end
```

## Common Prompt Mistakes to Avoid üö´

### 1. Being Too Vague

**Problem:** "Help me with my website"
**Solution:** "Help me improve the conversion rate of my SaaS landing page by analyzing the current copy and suggesting 3 specific changes"

### 2. Assuming AI Knows Your Context

**Problem:** "Continue from where we left off"
**Solution:** Always provide context in each prompt, even if you're continuing a conversation

### 3. Not Specifying Output Format

**Problem:** "List the benefits of exercise"
**Solution:** "List 7 benefits of exercise as bullet points, each with a brief 1-sentence explanation"

### 4. Asking Multiple Questions at Once

**Problem:** "What's the best programming language and how do I learn it and what projects should I build?"
**Solution:** Break into separate, focused prompts

### 5. Not Using Examples

**Problem:** "Write in a casual tone"
**Solution:** "Write in a casual tone like this example: 'Hey there! So you're thinking about learning Python? That's awesome! Let me tell you why it's a great choice...'"

## Advanced Techniques üöÄ

### 1. Prompt Chaining

Break complex tasks into a series of connected prompts:

```
Prompt 1: "Analyze this customer feedback data and identify the top 3 pain points"
Prompt 2: "Based on those pain points, suggest 3 product improvements"
Prompt 3: "Create a roadmap for implementing improvement #1"
```

### 2. Negative Prompting

Tell the AI what NOT to do:

```
Write a professional email to a client about project delays.

Do NOT:
- Make excuses
- Use overly technical language  
- Sound defensive
- Promise unrealistic timelines

DO:
- Take responsibility
- Provide clear next steps
- Offer solutions
- Maintain professional tone
```

### 3. Temperature Control (If Available)

```
For creative writing: Use higher temperature (0.7-0.9)
For factual information: Use lower temperature (0.1-0.3)
For code generation: Use medium temperature (0.3-0.5)
```

### 4. System Messages vs User Messages

Structure prompts properly:

```javascript
// System message (sets the AI's role and behavior)
"You are a helpful coding tutor who explains concepts clearly and provides working examples."

// User message (your actual request)
"Explain JavaScript promises with a real-world example and sample code."
```

## Practical Examples for Different Use Cases üí°

### Code Generation

```
Create a Python function that:
- Takes a list of dictionaries representing users
- Filters users who are over 18 and have verified emails
- Returns their names sorted alphabetically
- Include error handling for invalid input
- Add docstring and type hints
```

### Content Writing

```
Write a 300-word blog post introduction about remote work productivity.

Target audience: Marketing managers at mid-size companies
Tone: Professional but approachable
Goal: Introduce tips they'll learn in the full article
Include a surprising statistic in the first sentence
End with a hook that makes them want to keep reading
```

### Data Analysis

```
You are a data analyst. I have sales data showing:
- Q1 2023: $500K revenue, 1,200 customers
- Q2 2023: $650K revenue, 1,400 customers  
- Q3 2023: $580K revenue, 1,350 customers

Analyze trends, identify concerns, and suggest 3 specific actions 
to improve Q4 performance. Show your reasoning.
```

### Learning and Explanation

```
I'm learning React hooks. Explain useState like I'm coming from 
vanilla JavaScript background.

- Use a real-world analogy
- Show before/after code comparison
- Explain why hooks are better than the old way
- Give me a simple exercise to practice
```

## Testing and Improving Your Prompts üß™

### 1. A/B Testing

Try different approaches:

```
Version A: "Write a product description for wireless headphones"
Version B: "Write a compelling 100-word product description for wireless headphones targeting fitness enthusiasts, highlighting noise cancellation and sweat resistance"
```

### 2. Iteration Strategy

Start simple, then add details:

```
Iteration 1: "Explain machine learning"
Iteration 2: "Explain machine learning for business managers"
Iteration 3: "Explain machine learning for business managers in retail, focusing on practical applications like recommendation systems and inventory optimization"
```

### 3. Prompt Templates

Create reusable templates for common tasks:

```
**Code Review Template:**
Review this [LANGUAGE] code for [PURPOSE]. 
Focus on:
- Correctness
- Performance  
- Security
- Best practices

Code:
[CODE_HERE]

Provide specific suggestions with examples.
```

## Building a Prompt Library üìö

Keep a collection of effective prompts:

### Content Creation
```
"Act as a [ROLE] writing for [AUDIENCE]. Create [CONTENT_TYPE] about [TOPIC] that [GOAL]. Tone: [TONE]. Length: [LENGTH]. Include [SPECIFIC_REQUIREMENTS]."
```

### Problem Solving
```
"I'm facing [PROBLEM]. My constraints are [CONSTRAINTS]. My goal is [GOAL]. Walk me through 3 different solution approaches, explaining pros and cons of each."
```

### Learning
```
"Teach me [TOPIC] assuming I know [BACKGROUND_KNOWLEDGE]. Use [TEACHING_METHOD]. Include [PRACTICAL_ELEMENTS]. Check my understanding with [ASSESSMENT_METHOD]."
```

## Quick Reference: Prompt Checklist ‚úÖ

Before sending your prompt, ask yourself:

- [ ] Is my request specific and clear?
- [ ] Have I provided enough context?
- [ ] Did I specify the output format I want?
- [ ] Would examples make this clearer?
- [ ] Are there any constraints I should mention?
- [ ] Am I asking for one thing or multiple things?
- [ ] Would breaking this into steps help?
